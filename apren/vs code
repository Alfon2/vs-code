"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indi
gnation and dislike men who are so beguiled and d
emoralized by the charms of pleasure of the mome
nt, so blinded by desire, that they cannot forese
e the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and eq
ual blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through we
akness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These c
ases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when 
nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in c
ertain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures h
ave to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selecti
on: he rejects pleasures to secu
re other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
